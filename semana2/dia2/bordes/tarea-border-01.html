    <h1> DONT LOOK BACK IN ANGER</h1>

    <p id="primera"> Slip inside the eye of your mind
        Don't you know you might find
        A better place to play
        You said that you'd never been
        But all the things that you've seen
        Slowly fade away</p>
    <p id="segunda">So I start a revolution from my bed
        'Cause you said the brains I had went to my head
        Step outside, summertime's in bloom
        Stand up beside the fireplace
        Take that look from off your face
        You ain't ever gonna burn my heart out</p>
    <p id="tercera">And so Sally can wait
        She knows it's too late
        As we're walking on by
        Her soul slides away
        But don't look back in anger
        I heard you say</p>
    <p id="cuarta">Take me to the place where you go
        Where nobody knows
        If it's night or day
        But please don't put your life in the hands
        Of a rock and roll band
        Who'll throw it all away</p>
